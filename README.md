# [Bit Vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array)

> A bit array (also known as bitmap, bitset, bit string, or bit vector) is an array data structure that compactly stores bits. It can be used to implement a simple set data structure. A bit array is effective at exploiting bit-level parallelism in hardware to perform operations quickly.
